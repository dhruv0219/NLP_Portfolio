## Technical Skills

There were many technical skills that were learned during the creation of this portfolio with most of them relating to NLP. Here is a list of some of the skills
that were learned while creating many of these projects:

* Using the python package re to use regex in text preprocessing that can be later used in text cleanup
* Using packages such as NLTK for creating word and sentence tokens
* Using NLTK for speech tagging figure out specific parts of speech
* Using wordnet to find out word hierarchy, collocations, word sentiment, and similarity algorithms.
* Using bi-grams and N-grams to figure out certain word sequences that can lead to classifying a language
* The different ways of parsing a sentence such as semantic role labeling, dependency parsing and many others.
* How to use sklearn to build out models of Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and Logistic Regressions.
* How to use Keras and Tensorflow to build out models of CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Embedding

Along with this I was able to better familiarize myself with resources such as google colab, kaggle, Github, and the ACL website.

## Soft Skills

During the creation of this portfolio there were many opportunities to work with a partner and further develop my soft skills. Here is a list of soft skills
I was able to develp and showcase:

* During many of the projects in which I worked with a partner we would often have ideas that conflicted one another so communication was imperative in making sure that we both heard out each others ideas and then proceeded with the best one.
* Scheduling and blocking out time to work with a busy schedule was extremely important in making sure that I was able to have ample time to work on the projects to make sure that it was to the highest standard.
* There were many instances as well where it was important to stay patient and approach problems with a different perspective. Many of the problems that I may have had were easily solved by taking a step back and looking at it with a different view.
* One of the main skills that was important to have throughout the entire process was being flexible and open to learning new ideas. There would be times when students would have opportunities to present their projects and it was important to be able to listen and learn and see how they approached a problem that I was working on.

I was able to keep myself and a partner on track with tools such as a kanban board and draw.io for diagram designs.
