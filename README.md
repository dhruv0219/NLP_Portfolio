# NLP_Portfolio
Portfolio for NLP projects

## Portfolio 0

This is an introduction into NLP and how my interests align with the field. You can see the [Overview of NLP here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Homework 1

This program takes in data and processes the text to make it readable and presentable using regex. After the data is processed it is then presented to the user. You can see the [file here](Homework1).

## Homework 2

This program takes in a file and collects the 50 most common words out of the text and then allows the user to play a guess game where they try to guess the word. The program utilizes nltk to lemmatize each word and allow for each word to be unique. It also allows us to calculate what words are nouns and use those words as the main portion of the guessing game. You can see the [file here](Homework2).

## Homework 3

This file looks into the use of WordNet and some of the other tools associated with it such as Lesk algorithm, Wu Palmer, SentiWordNet, Collocations and many other tools. This file was originally a google colab notebook, but was converted into a pdf and uploaded here. You can see the [file here](Homework3_Dxt180017ipynb.pdf).
