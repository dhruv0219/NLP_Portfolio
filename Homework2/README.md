## Homework 2

This program takes in a file and collects the 50 most common words out of the text and then allows the user to play a guess game where they try to guess the word.
The program utilizes nltk to lemmatize each word and allow for each word to be unique. It also allows us to calculate what words are nouns and use those words as the main portion of the guessing game.

### How to run the program

in order to run the program the user must install nltk onto their computer. Once Nltk has been installed the user must then use the tool **import nltk** in the python console.
Once nltk has been imported the user must then download the required nltk tools using **nltk.download()**. Once the required nltk tools are downloaded the user can then run the program by typing in 
**python3 Homework2_Dxt180017 filepath**

### Lessons learnt

Overall it was a very fun project to work on as it was interesting getting to work with nltk and seeing how certain things such as the parts of speech tagging works.
It was also very interesting to see how quick it was able to take a large body of text and transform it into tokens and specific values that stopped due to whatever stopwords may be present.
