## Homework 1

This program takes in a file that contains details such as first name, last name, middle initial, ID, and phone number of different people in
a company. The program cleans up the data and processes it to make sure that the data is readable and presentable.

### How to Run the Program

In order to run the program, the user must first install re, sys, path, and pickle using pip install.
To run the program after installing the tools, the next step is to run the program with command line prompt.
In order to run it, enter **python3 Homework1_Dxt180017 filepath**.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Python For Data Processing

Python is mainly filled with strengths when it comes to data processing. There are a lot of tools and downloads that make the job much easier to
work with data processing and clean up. Aside from basic regex, there are even tools such as pandas and numpy that make it even easier to process
and clean up data. Along with this, storing values in lists, dictionaries, and tuples make it easier to combine different data types as well as allowing
for easier clean up and process.

### Lessons Learnt ###

The main thing I learnt from this assignment was how to use pickle. Pickling a dictionary reads it as a byte steram and then turns it back into an object. Using
regex however, was a review for me as I have used regex in data processing for past machine learning classes. Along with this, I had experience working with python
on different projects before.
