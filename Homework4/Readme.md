## How to run the program

The first step is to download and import nltk as well as install pickle onto your computer. Once you have all the imports and downloads installed then the
first step is to run the first part of the code which is using the command **python3 Homework4_Dxt180017.py**. Once you have ran part one, you can then run part two 
which is run with the command **python3 Homework4_Dxt180017_part2.py**.

## Lessons learned

This assignemnt was very fun to work with as building the N-grams to later figure out what language a file was containing was an interesting process. 
It was a look into how things such as language translators may work by creating N-grams and bi-grams to figure out how certain sequence of words may work. It 
was also interesting to see how common certain combinations of words appeared many times in comparison to others and how to construct sentences out of them.
